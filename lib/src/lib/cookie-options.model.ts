/**
 * @name CookieOptionsArgs
 * @description
 *
 * Object containing default options to pass when setting cookies.
 *
 * The object may have following properties:
 *
 * - **path** - {string} - The cookie will be available only for this path and its
 *   sub-paths. By default, this is the URL that appears in your `<base>` tag.
 * - **domain** - {string} - The cookie will be available only for this domain and
 *   its sub-domains. For security reasons the user agent will not accept the cookie
 *   if the current domain is not a sub-domain of this domain or equal to it.
 * - **expires** - {string|Date} - String of the form "Wdy, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT"
 *   or a Date object indicating the exact date/time this cookie will expire.
 * - **secure** - {boolean} - If `true`, then the cookie will only be available through a
 *   secured connection.
 * - **httpOnly** - {boolean} - If `true`, then the cookie will be set with the `HttpOnly`
 *   flag, and will only be accessible from the remote server. Helps to prevent against
 *   XSS attacks.
 * - **sameSite** - {"Lax"|"Strict"|"None"} - Designates cookie for first party (Lax|Strict)
 *   or third party contexts.
 * - **storeUnencoded** - {boolean} - If `true`, then the cookie value will not be encoded and
 *   will be stored as provided.
